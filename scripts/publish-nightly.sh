# Publishes the current commit as a "nightly-YYYYMMDD-<sha>" pre-release with the DMGs in dist/.
#
# Why one release per commit: with GitHub's "immutable releases" a tag name can never be reused,
# so the old "delete and recreate the `nightly` release" approach fails from the second build on.
# Change history is carried forward from the previous nightly's notes, and only the newest
# KEEP_NIGHTLIES (default 1, the newest) release is kept; its notes hold the full history. Deleted
# releases leave their tags behind, which is harmless.
#
# Needs: gh (authenticated via GH_TOKEN), GITHUB_SHA, a full git checkout, dist/*.dmg.
