# Speech fixtures

`dictation-en.m4a` and `dictation-es.m4a` are short synthetic clips used by
`scripts/run-speech-test.sh`. They were generated with Edge TTS voices
`en-US-AriaNeural` and `es-US-PalomaNeural` from these fixed sentences:

- English: "Remember to check the battery and the CPU usage after the build finishes, then paste the notes into the report."
- Spanish: "Recuerda revisar la batería y el uso del procesador cuando termine la compilación."

The clips are text-to-speech output and contain no personal data or real voices.

## Regenerating

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate && pip install edge-tts
edge-tts --voice <voice> --text "<sentence>" --write-media x.mp3
afconvert -f m4af -d aac -b 32000 -c 1 x.mp3 dictation-<lang>.m4a
```

Use `en` with `en-US-AriaNeural` and `es` with `es-US-PalomaNeural`.

## Caveat

The licensing terms for reusing Edge TTS output have not been verified.
